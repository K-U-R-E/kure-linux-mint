Description:

- Created a shell script to setup a linux image with various bits and bobs to help newer members learning to code etc
- Installs
  - Neovim
  - Fish
  - Tmux
  - Rclone
  - GCC
  - Pipx (Global Install)
  - Miniconda3 (Global Install)
  - AEL's DAQ Software (Not available in repo)
  - User accounts (Standard setup)
  - Adds Vinay's customisation of using fish background in nvim
  - Adds Vinay's nvim preferences


Notes:

If you would like to use this you would have to disable the AEL installation portion as the binaries are not publicly distributed with this repo but brought in as a submodule from a private repo. Would also recommend that you change the user account setup as well
